## Naming Consistency Analysis

### ✅ Consistent Patterns Found:
1. **Category_action format**: All tools follow the underscore convention
2. **Action verbs**: Consistently use `get`, `list`, `add`, `update`, `delete`, `set`, `analyze`, `apply`
3. **Noun consistency**: Generally good with some minor issues

### 🔍 Minor Inconsistencies:

1. **Singular vs Plural Usage**:
   - `list_vehicles` (plural) vs `add_vehicle` (singular) - This is actually correct! List operations return multiple items, single operations use singular
   - `get_vehicle_leads` (plural) - Correct, returns multiple leads
   - `list_available_portals` (plural) - Correct, returns multiple portals

2. **Verb Consistency**:
   - `search_vehicle_specs` uses "search" instead of "get" or "list" - This is intentional as it's a progressive/smart search
   - `compare_vehicle_options` uses "compare" - Appropriate for the comparison functionality

3. **Prefix Consistency**:
   - Most vehicle-related tools use `vehicle_` prefix consistently
   - `get_transmission_types` doesn't have `vehicle_` prefix (minor inconsistency)
   - `set_main_image` doesn't have `vehicle_` prefix (should be `set_vehicle_main_image` for consistency)

4. **User/Company Context**:
   - `get_user_context` and `list_user_companies` use "user" prefix
   - `list_company_dealers` switches to "company" prefix
   - This is semantically correct but could be more consistent

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority (Breaking Changes):
None - The naming is generally very good and follows MCP conventions well.

### Low Priority (Non-Breaking Improvements):
1. Consider renaming `set_main_image` to `set_vehicle_main_image` for consistency
2. Consider adding `vehicle_` prefix to `get_transmission_types` → `get_vehicle_transmission_types`

### Best Practices Followed ✅:
1. **Clear action-oriented names**: Every tool clearly indicates what it does
2. **Consistent underscore convention**: All tools use snake_case
3. **No ambiguous names**: Each tool has a distinct, unambiguous purpose
4. **Category grouping**: Tools are well-organized by domain
5. **Verb-first pattern**: Most tools follow the verb_noun pattern appropriately

## MCP Best Practices Compliance

### ✅ Compliant:
