# Next Steps & Future Enhancements

## üöÄ Priority Enhancements

### 1. Lead Management Integration üÜï
- **Objective**: Add comprehensive lead management capabilities
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.dealerk.it/v2/` lead list endpoint
- **Features to implement**:
  - `list_leads` - Fetch and filter customer leads
  - `get_lead_analytics` - Lead generation metrics
- **Priority**: High - Critical for complete CRM integration
- **Estimated effort**: 2-3 days
- **Dependencies**: Access to Dealerk v2 API credentials

### 2. Image Upload Refinement
- **Issue**: Uploaded images not set as main image properly
- **Affected vehicles**: FIAT 500 (ID: 9476352)
- **Symptom**: Images upload successfully but appear as "ghost" images (not visible in UI)
- **Root cause**: Uploaded images have `"main": false` instead of `"main": true`
- **Location**: `src/api/images.js:78-80` - main image setting logic
- **Next steps**:
  - [ ] Fix main image setting logic in upload process
  - [ ] Add validation to ensure uploaded images are properly set as main
  - [ ] Add retry logic for main image setting
  - [ ] Test with actual image files (not cross-vehicle uploads)

- **Issue**: Publication endpoints return 404 Not Found
- **Affected endpoints**: 
  - `/{country}/publications/{vehicleId}/{activationCode}:publish`
  - `/{country}/publications/{vehicleId}/{activationCode}:unpublish`
- **Root cause**: Invalid activation codes or incorrect API structure
- **Next steps**:
  - [ ] Investigate correct publication API endpoints
  - [ ] Obtain valid portal activation codes
  - [ ] Test with proper portal credentials
  - [ ] Add better error handling for publication failures
  - [ ] Document correct portal configuration
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated effort**: 2 days
