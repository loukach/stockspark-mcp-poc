### **2. Setup Credentials & Test**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Test your setup first before connecting to AI agents!**

1. **Create `.env` file** (copy from `.env.example`):
```bash
# Required - StockSpark Authentication
STOCKSPARK_USERNAME=your-email@dealership.com
STOCKSPARK_PASSWORD=your-password
STOCKSPARK_CLIENT_ID=carspark-api
STOCKSPARK_AUTH_URL=https://auth.motork.io/realms/prod/protocol/openid-connect/token

# Required - API Configuration  
STOCKSPARK_API_URL=https://carspark-api.dealerk.com

# Optional - Portal Publishing
MYPORTAL_ACTIVATION_CODE=your-myportal-code
AUTOMOBILE_IT_ACTIVATION_CODE=your-automobile-it-code

# Optional - Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

2. **Verify your credentials work**:
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
npm test

# If tests pass, you're ready to connect to AI!
# If tests fail, check your credentials in .env
```

**Note:** Company and dealer IDs are auto-discovered from your credentials.

### **3. Connect to Claude Desktop**

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stockspark": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/stockspark-mcp-poc/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "STOCKSPARK_USERNAME": "your-email@dealership.com",
        "STOCKSPARK_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "STOCKSPARK_CLIENT_ID": "carspark-api",
        "STOCKSPARK_AUTH_URL": "https://auth.motork.io/realms/prod/protocol/openid-connect/token",

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **4. Start Using with AI**

Once connected, you can give Claude natural language instructions:

```
"Add a 2021 Mercedes S 500 with 87k km and price it at ‚Ç¨34,000"
"Show me vehicles that have been in stock over 90 days"
"Upload images for vehicle 12345 from /tmp/car_photos/"
"*paste images* Save these to filesystem then upload to vehicle 12345"
"Apply a 10% discount to underperforming BMWs"
"Publish vehicle 12345 to MyPortal and Automobile.it"
```
