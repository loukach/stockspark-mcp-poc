# Known Issues & Bug Tracker

This document tracks known issues, planned fixes, and architectural improvements for the StockSpark MCP server.

## ✅ Recently Resolved Issues

### 1. Vehicle List Sorting and Enhanced Filtering ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Component:** Vehicle Tools  
**Resolution Date:** 2025-01-25

**Problem (RESOLVED):**
- `list_vehicles` tool lacked sorting and comprehensive filtering
- No way to list recently created vehicles first
- Make/model filtering used incorrect filter syntax instead of direct parameters

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Added sorting parameter with format `"field:direction"` (e.g., `"creationDate:desc"`)
- ✅ Enhanced filtering with make, model, numberPlate, vehicleType, mileage range
- ✅ Fixed make/model filtering to use direct API parameters instead of filters
- ✅ Smart name-to-ID resolution for make and model names

**Files Modified:**
- `src/tools/vehicle-tools.js` - Enhanced schema with new parameters
- `src/api/vehicles.js` - Fixed make/model resolution and direct parameter usage

---

### 2. Wrong Date Field Exposed in Vehicle Data ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Component:** Vehicle Tools, Data Mapping  
**Resolution Date:** 2025-01-25

**Problem (RESOLVED):**
- Was exposing `enteredInStockDate` instead of `creationDate` in vehicle data
- Made it impossible to track when vehicles were actually created in the system

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Updated vehicle data mapping to expose `creationDate` instead of `enteredInStockDate`
- ✅ Fixed performance analysis to use `creationDate` for days-in-stock calculations

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/mappers.js` - Updated `formatVehicleResponse()` and `analyzeVehiclePerformance()`

### 3. Vehicle Color Updates Failing ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Component:** Vehicle Tools, API Integration  
**Resolution Date:** 2025-01-25

**Problem (RESOLVED):**
- Color updates via `update_vehicle` failed with validation errors
- Required both `color` and `colorBase` fields to be consistent

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Enhanced `updateVehicle` method to automatically lookup and set both color fields
- ✅ Added case-insensitive color matching
- ✅ Improved error handling and user guidance
- ✅ Created comprehensive COLOR_UPDATE_GUIDE.md

**Files Modified:**
- `src/api/vehicles.js` - Enhanced color update logic
- `src/tools/vehicle-tools.js` - Updated tool description with color guidance
- `docs/COLOR_UPDATE_GUIDE.md` - Complete usage guide

---

### 4. Tool Consolidation and Naming ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Component:** All Tools  
**Resolution Date:** 2025-01-25

**Achievements:**
- ✅ **Reduced tools from 41 to 36** (12% reduction)
- ✅ **Reference tools: 17 → 10** (41% reduction)
- ✅ **Consistent naming**: All tools follow `category_action` pattern
- ✅ **Terminology correction**: Replaced "trims" with "versions" throughout
- ✅ **Removed duplicates**: Eliminated 7 redundant/legacy tools

**Major Changes:**
- Image upload tools: 3 → 1 (removed duplicates)
- Reference tools: Removed 7 legacy tools
- Tool naming: Standardized to MCP best practices
- API terminology: Fixed "trims" → "versions"

---

### 5. Delete Vehicle Feature ✅ **ADDED**
**Component:** Vehicle Tools  
**Resolution Date:** 2025-01-25

**New Feature:**
- ✅ Added secure vehicle deletion with safety confirmation
- ✅ Two-step confirmation process prevents accidental deletions
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- ✅ Created DELETE_VEHICLE_GUIDE.md with complete documentation

**Files Added/Modified:**
- `src/api/vehicles.js` - Added `deleteVehicle` method
- `src/tools/vehicle-tools.js` - Added `delete_vehicle` tool
- `docs/DELETE_VEHICLE_GUIDE.md` - Complete usage guide

## 🔴 Outstanding Issues

### 1. Auto-Main Image Feature Not Working
**Status:** 🔴 Open  
**Priority:** High  
**Component:** Image Tools  

**Problem:**
- First uploaded image not automatically set as main image
- `main` flag remains `false` even for first image on vehicles with no existing images
- Auto-main image logic exists but isn't functioning correctly

**Impact:**
- Vehicles have no main image despite having uploaded images
- Poor presentation in vehicle listings
- Manual intervention required to set main images

**Files to Investigate:**
- `src/api/images.js` - Lines 105-113 (auto-main logic)
- `src/tools/image-tools.js` - Image upload handlers

---

### 2. hasImages Flag Always False
**Status:** 🔴 Open  
**Priority:** High  
**Component:** Vehicle Tools, Data Mapping  

**Problem:**
- `hasImages` field in `list_vehicles` response always shows `false`
- Incorrect even when vehicles actually have images
- Cannot filter or identify vehicles that need images

**Impact:**
- Cannot distinguish vehicles with/without images
- Inefficient workflow for image management
- Filtering by image status doesn't work

**Files to Investigate:**
- `src/utils/mappers.js` - `formatVehicleListResponse()` function
- `src/api/vehicles.js` - Vehicle list API response processing
